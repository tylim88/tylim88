Hi, I am Tylim.

I love to code in Typescript and am obsessed with writing absolute type-safe code.

I am a tool thinker, most of my open-source projects focus on developing tools that help developers write type-safe scalable dry code.

The ecosystem that I am contributing to right now is Firebase, not because I use Firebase for my project but because the ecosystem is still young and there is not many high-quality project yet, so there is more room to cook stuffs.

Eventhough I don't use Firebase in production, but rest assure that my project quality is the best of its kind out there.

Don't take my words for it, compare them yourself and if you found something better, let me know.

Take a look at FirelordJS, it is my finest open source project, crafted with heart and soul.

Enjoy your stay!
