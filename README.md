Hi, I am Tylim.

I love to code in Typescript and am obsessed with writing absolute type-safe code. I also enjoy writing scalable and dry code.

Most of my open-source projects focus on developing tools that help developers write type-safe scalable dry code.

The ecosystem that I am contributing to right now is Firebase.

The reason I choose Firebase is that the ecosystem is still young and there is not much high-quality project yet, so there is more room to cook some stuffs.

If you are Typescript lover and you are looking for cool Typescript project, take a look ar FirelordJS, it is my finest open source project.

Enjoy your stay!
